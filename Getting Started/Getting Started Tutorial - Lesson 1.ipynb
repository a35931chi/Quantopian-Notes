It covers many of the basics of Quantopian's API, and is designed for those who are new to the platform. All you need to get started on this tutorial is to have some basic [Python](https://docs.python.org/2.7/) programming skills."

To do this, we can use Quantopian's Research environment to access and analyze historical datasets available in the platform.
