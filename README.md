Please refer to the folder 'Lessons' for Quantopian lessons. They are often times verbatim. Since code can only be ran on Quantopian's platform, all the code won't be executed, and all the expected output won't appear. Please find all the Lessons [HERE](https://www.quantopian.com/tutorials/getting-started#lesson1).


Please refer to the folder 'Research' for my own research and input.
