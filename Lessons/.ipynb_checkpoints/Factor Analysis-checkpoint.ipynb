    "How can we tell whether an alpha factor is good or not? Unfortunately, there is no cut-off that tells you whether a factor is objectively useful. Instead, we need to compare a particular factor to other options before deciding whether to use it. Our end goal in defining and selecting the best factors is to use them to rank stocks in a long-short equity strategy, covered elsewhere in the [lecture series](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures#Long-Short-Equity). The more independent predictive the factors we use, the better our ranking scheme and our overall strategy will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want when comparing factors is to make sure the chosen signal is actually predictive of **relative price movements**. We do not want to predict the absolute amount the assets in our universe will move up or down. We only care that we can choose assets to long that will do better than the assets we short. In a long-short equity strategy, we hold a long basket and a short basket of assets, determined by the factor values associated with each asset in our universe. If our ranking scheme is predictive, this means that assets in the top basket will tend to outperform assets in the bottom basket. As long this spread is consistent over time our strategy will have a positive return.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An individual factor can have a lot of moving parts to assess, but ideally it should be independent of other factors that you are already trading on in order to keep your portfolio diverse. We discuss the reasoning for this in [this lecture](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures#Position-Concentration-Risk). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we detail and explain relevant statistics to evaluate your alpha factor before attempting to implement it in an algorithm. What's important to keep in mind is that all the metrics provided here are relative to other factors you may be trading or evaluating. \n",

    "Let's have a look at a factor and try to assess its viability. We will calculate the factor values using Pipeline, so make sure you check out the [tutorial](https://www.quantopian.com/tutorials/pipeline) if you are unfamiliar with how Pipeline works."

For more background on the mathematics associated with the IC, check out the [Spearman Rank Correlation Lecture](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures#Spearman-Rank-Correlation). To break it down, we calculate the IC between the factor values and the forward returns for each period. The IC assesses the monotonic relationship between factors and returns. What this means, intuitively, is that it provides a measure for whether higher factor values can be associated with higher returns. A higher IC indicates that higher factor values are more closely associated with higher return values (and lower factor values with lower return values). A very negative IC indicates that higher factor values are closely associated with lower return values. An IC of $0$ indicates no relationship.\n",

We need to include how the market at large will react to the trades we're making (market impact/slippage) as well as the transaction costs associated with making those trades. These influences can erode our profits if we do not properly assess their impact through extensive testing.\n",
